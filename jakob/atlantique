I have setup a web page for the Lajolla workshop.

Currently it  lists the papers to be presented and links to the
two abstracts that I have files for (papers by David Sands and
Mitch Wand). 

Please send to me *ASAP* either a url pointing to your abstract
or a ps file with the abstract so we can have a simple
online preworkshop proceedings.   I'll be glad to put in
*links* to full versions of the paper as well. 

The url for this page is

 http://www-formal.stanford.edu/pub/clt/Atlantique/95postpepm/work.html

As Neil pointed out, we  would like abstracts  from ALL attending
who have recent work or have problems to study
that are directly relevant to Atlantique collaboration
for the printed informal proceedings.  It would be nice to
have links to these paper before the workshop as well.
Please send me authors, title and url  if you have something
to contribute.

Finally, for the informal proceedings, we would like to encourage the
possibility of little notes/abstracts written by collaborators 
as a result of the discussions at meeting.


Regards,
Carolyn
