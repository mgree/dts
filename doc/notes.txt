Notes:

-- Quotation, backquotation

quote does not have to be a type specific operation: 
o for booleans, characters, strings, symbols, literal vectors, numbers,
  it is simply the identity function
o lists/pairs, it is, too!

-- Dynamic-to-boolean conversion

add a case for an exception that says "False" to yield false


-- Improper lists

Improper lists are only necessary for the append procedure.  Currently
the append procedure operates only on lists of (proper lists).  A
work-around is to offer a "dynamic" append function which works on
dynamic objects and creates pairs.

-- Strings

make-string with only one argument is not implemented

-- Numbers

number2string with multiple arguments has only that with all arguments

-- Vectors

make-vector is only there with explicit fill argument

-- Delay/force

Force is not implemented correctly, as repeated forcing just repeats
the calculation of the value.  Delay actually computes the value first
and is only useful if the argument really terminates.

-- IO

Problem with mutual dependence of port on dynamic and vice versa.
