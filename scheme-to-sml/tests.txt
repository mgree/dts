Input : ((lambda (x) (if x 1 1))  1)

Output : no coercions inserted

Comment : This is wrong


(2)

Input : ((lambda x (x 1)  1)

Output : Coercions inserted

Comment : This is right. Comparing with (1) may suggest that
          the problem lies in handling complex parameter patterns.



(3)

Input : (if #t #t 1)

Output : Coercions are inserted

Comment : This is right


(4)

Input : (if #t '(1 . 2) '(#t . #f))

Output : No coercions inserted

Comment : This is wrong. Comparing with (3) appears to suggest
          that something is wring with unification for
          induced flow. Perhaps the problem is related to
          the problem in (1) (?)


(5)

Input : (1 1)

Output : Coercions inserted

Comment : This is right.


(6)

Input : (((lambda x x) 1)  1)

Output : No coercions inserted

Comment : Again, the problem appears to come with more complex flow.
