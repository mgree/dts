[Fritz Henglein](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~henglein/) and [Jakob
Rehof](https://ls14-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/cms/en/staff/profs/Rehof)
did foundational work thinking about dynamic type systems back in the
1990s. Fritz's [framework for
coercions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642394000042)
remains a powerful way to express the runtime checks used in gradual
typing; their [Scheme-to-ML
compiler](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/224164.224203) implemented
that theory in a very thoroughgoing way.

Fritz has kindly shared the source code with me. I've posted it here
for others to learn from (and to try to get it working!).
